## Game Project Overview :page_facing_up:

# Game Project Application Form

## 1. Pitch the Game

### Please describe the game in a short pitch.
Eterraverse: Dawn of Eterra is a fully on chain game in which Cards are minted into a complex Collect, Craft, and Compete Card game. Each card features a different Monster, Boss, NPC or Playable Character from the Eterraverse Lore. The game is a companion app to our wider gaming ecosystem. The game mixes and adapts from the mechanics of many well known games, from simple capturing based on value, to complex battles. We implement a combination of Rank, Genetics, Battle Arrows, and Battle Classes to create a strategic hybrid-deterministic battle system. Dawn of Eterra players compete with their genetically unique Cards to collect Resources and earn Experience. Resources allow players to alter their Card's attributes, as well as Forge new Equipment to each card. Experience allows players to level their cards, potentially increasing certain attributes along the way. Legendary and Mythical Weapons and Armor will grant specific Perks in the battle mathematics.
The winner is allowed to "Clone" one perishable copy of a card they have captured from their opponents hand. This Clone will be automatically burned after the completion of the first match it participates in. The game's returns are the following Resources: Ingredients, Materials, and magical Essence, which must be obtained through playing and winning matches. Crafting together Formulas of these Resources results in more powerful equipment and spells which can be Forged to cards to increase its Rank and genetic attributes.  

### Please describe the game's core loop? (minimalistic)
Collect -> Craft -> Compete

### Are there any existing games that you would consider similar to your project?
Dawn of Eterra combines and expands on mechanics from various games, from capturing opponents Cards, to complex battles from a cards attributes/genetics.  It acts as a companion app for a wider ecosystem, like card games Triple Triad and Tetra Master (Final Fantasy). We use mechanics like Ranks, Card Capture, and Battles, and expand on those system with a collection and crafting loop.

## 2. Game Dev Experience

### Have you built games prior to this bounty request?
This will be our first completed and shipped game as a newly founded studio.

### Do any of the previously mentioned games have a Web3 component?
We have not yet created a web3 game, but have been in talks with Ajuna to utilize existing infrastructure for on-chain implementations.

### Do you have experience in working with game engines, such as Unity & Unreal?
We have experience working with games in Unity but this will be the first shipped title. 

## 3. Technical Expertise

### How much of your game logic do you intend to build on the blockchain?
- [ ] None, I just want a token.
- [ ] Only the Game Assets/NFTs should remain on-chain.
- [ ] Some mechanics will need to be on-chain.
- [X] This should be a fully on-chain game.
- [ ] Other: 

### Do you have any expertise in Blockchain Development?
- [ ] No, none at all.
- [ ] I know how the Blockchain works, but never developed anything in crypto.
- [ ] I have EVM / SmartContract experience.
- [ ] I have only used SDK for my games on other platforms.
- [X] I know Rust & Substrate and can create basic runtime code.
- [ ] Other:

### Would you like a technical Team from Polkadot Play, to help you identify the technical requirements?
We have been in contact with the folks at Ajuna to align on technical requirements. We have designed the game around their existing infrastructure, and have plans to expand with our own pallets to be released open-source for the Ajuna runtime.

## 5. Development

### Development Status :open_book:
https://github.com/eca20/EterraCards

This is a forked copy of an implementation of Triple Triad from Final Fantasy 8 released under the MIT License that contains base functionality (placing a card and card comparison) and simple Unity assets. We have begun altering this repository to implement our prototype game as UI and artwork are produced over the coming months. 

### What are the key milestones for your game's development, and what are the estimated completion dates for each?
- **Milestone 1:** GDD and Pitch Deck
- **Milestone 2:** Prototype game with base functionality, tested on a running Ajuna node
- **Milestone 3:** Prototype with Resource Collection and Crafting
- **Milestone 4:** Prototype will full Card Battle Functionality
- **Milestone 5:** Final artwork, UI components
- **Milestone 6:** Fully testable beta, Early Access Release

### Are you intending to raise more funds?
We intend to invest earnings from initial NFT sales toward scaling the studio's capabilities with the goal of releasing additional titles that share on-chain assets. Using a lean agile development process, we will create models and assets shared by both the RPG and FPS, including playable characters, environments, NPCs, etc. These characters will be featured on future seasonal card releases and in the planned RPG and FPS titles. We also plan to seek funding from potential investors in the studio. The card game is our genesis to be released alongside an aggressive marketing campaign. We are currently working out a storyline and lore for the shared ecosystem that will not only inform gamers about the interconnected nature of our games, but to the benefits of a decentralized world.

## 7. Future Plans

We plan to fund continued development through the sale of NFTs, future applicable grant applications of OpenSource pallets to the PolkadotPlay infrastructure, and seeking funding from other investors with a shared interested in the growth of a wider web3 ecosystem. We have a marketing strategy in place including the release of vertical slice trailers, a robust social media campaign, incentives for early adopters, and a presence at major gaming and blockchain conferences. We intend for this game to be the first in a suite of web3 interconnected games. 

## 8. Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:
We are interested in feedback on our milestone breakdown as the exact order and specific contents is flexible. We can also provide more granularity if necessary. In general, we plan to develop the games front end alongside a pallet produced in collaboration with Ajuna. At the same time, our creative team will produce original artwork, which will be implemented into the Unity app once it is finished in a future milestone. In the meantime, placeholder images will be used to allow demos for each milestone. We plan to eventually create more complex Unity artwork and graphics, but the first season release is intended to be produced fully from hand drawn images, each NFT representing collectible "concept art" that doubles as a playable trading card, exclusive for our ecosystem's early adopters.
